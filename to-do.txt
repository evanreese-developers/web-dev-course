see if there is some way to keep the content from the etc and usr directories in sync with their own volumes
remove the usr and etc direcories from the project and move to their own so 1 manages code and 1 manages infastructure
add commands to playbook to establish the ssh handshake and passwordless connect to the vm from local
get vagrant to use correct version of ansible for permissions

desired behavior, vagrant up and vm is at correct ip with all code files mapped from the code repo to the vm and displaying when the private host is accessed
